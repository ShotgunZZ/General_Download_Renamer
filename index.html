# Privacy Policy for General Download Renamer

**Last Updated:** [April 28, 2025]

This Privacy Policy describes how the General Download Renamer Chrome Extension ("the Extension") handles your information.

**Information We Collect and Use:**

*   **User Configuration:** The Extension stores your configured renaming pattern, separator choice, and enable/disable state locally on your computer using the `chrome.storage.local` API. This information is necessary for the Extension to function according to your preferences and is **never transmitted off your computer**.
*   **Download Metadata:** When a download occurs, the Extension temporarily accesses the download's original filename and source URL solely for the purpose of generating the new filename based on your pattern. This metadata is processed locally and is **not stored** after the renaming is complete.
*   **Floating Icon:** The Extension uses a content script to display a floating icon on web pages. This script requires permission to run on websites solely to display and manage this UI element. The script **does not collect, store, or transmit any content** from the web pages you visit.

**Information We Do NOT Collect:**

The Extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII), web browsing history, location data, financial information, authentication credentials, personal communications, or any other sensitive data.

**Data Storage and Transmission:**

All data handled by the Extension (user configuration) is stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local`. No data is transmitted to any external servers or third parties.

**(Future AI Features Note):** If future versions of the Extension introduce AI features that require sending data (like URLs or page titles) to external services, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly, and such features will be optional or require explicit user consent where appropriate.

**Changes to This Policy:**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension's store listing.
